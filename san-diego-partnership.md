# SAN DIEGO PARTNERSHIP

## BACKGROUND
[Data For Democracy](datafordemocracy.org) is partnering directly with the City of San Diego to help design, build, and maintain sustainable products for the city. The goal of the partnership is to generate tools and analysis off of the city's open data portal, and use that information to generate active reports and tools for the citizens of the city.

## GOALS
We want to build a strong partnership with the data team at San Diego to help support and build great analysis and tools. With a focus on [the city's open data platform](http://data.sandiego.gov/), D4D teams will be tasked with defining impactful projects geared toward city initiatives and public awareness.

Through this partnership, we hope to tease meaningful insights out of the local data and help Maksim and his team communicate the narrative to the folks in San Diego. And, of course, our number one goal is to build great things together! 

## PROJECTS
The projects for the San Diego partnership will be loosely defined by Maksim and his team with strong collaboration amongst the San Diego D4D team. This will ensure that the projects that D4D engages in with the City of San Diego are not only relevant, but as impactful as possible in the day-to-day lives of San Diego's citizens.

Below are the current projects as well as their respective Project Leads.

### Climate Action Plan

**PROJECT LEAD(S)**
<br>TBD

**BACKGROUND**
In December 2015, the City of San Diego put in place a ["Climate Action Plan"](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/final_july_2016_cap.pdf) with the goal of cutting GHG emissions significantly and moving the city to renewable energy by 2035.

The plan aligns around three phases, the first of which runs through the end of 2017 and is geared toward pushing large emissions reductions. 

**PROJECT GOAL**
The city has managed to capture a ton of great data, and there's plenty of information out there about the CAP's initiatives. What the city wants to know is what (if any) the impact has been so far of the CAP.

Addition, who doesn't love a good set of KPIs to measure success against? This is a great opportunity to identify what the proper metrics should be for the purpose of measuring the results of the CAP. Whether this is in dashboard form or an analysis on the impact of the CAP on those metrics is yet to be determined!

**PROJECT DELIVERABLE**
There are several goals that go along with this project, and we want to keep the definition of the end-product as collaborative as possible. Therefore - we want to hear from you, D4D community! 

Using data from San Diego's open data portal, what insights can you glean out of the data and tie back to the city's initiative around climate action (is the city realizing significant benefits yet?). What kind of cool tools can you build (if we could build a monitoring dashboard, what data would be interesting to feed in)? This is your project - and for a few of you, this is your city - so let's talk!
